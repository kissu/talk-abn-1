## What do we have nowadays to make something more fancy?

<div class="pt-8 text-left">
<v-clicks>

- CSS grid coming with masonry out of the box + subgrid
- CSS being MORE powerful now ✨ + brand new `:has` (less need for JS)
- browser interop? yes please!
- simple yet powerful `accent-color` property
- color functions, get some insights/help 👉 https://colorjs.io/
- State of CSS @GoogleIO 🚀 [here](https://youtu.be/Xy9ZXRRgpLk) 🚀

</v-clicks>
</div>

<!--
masonry: no need for ugly JS solutions, we have it baked in now

CSS is more friendly to use everyday, more powerful thanks to some baked-in conditionals, cascade layers + container queries

:has bring a whole new world to CSS, enabling some new ways for selection

support getting better for a lot of browsers for all the main CSS features

simple yet brings more native customization in a simple and non-hacky way

COLORS are coming, more VIVID colors!!

color spaces can get quite complex with colors spaces but it enables some totally unseen colors on supported monitors (Apple Display XDR etc...)

# I want my 3D now! 🤩🤩

<!--
for 3D on the Web, we use WebGL, it's fast because it's using the GPU so that our users don't wait too long

we can generate millions of polygons in just a matter of milliseconds

we will then be able to get a nice image + it's a Web standard

we have some documentation, a standard etc...let's see how amazing it is!

let's see how to make a nice cube thanks to WebGL

[presentation of the hardcore codebase 😱]

not that amazing huh? not gonna write that kind of code daily unfortunately 😪

<h2 class="mb-8 !text-4xl">Why would somebody use ThreeJS? ✨</h2>

<div class="text-left">
<v-clicks>

- a lot is available out of the box
- no need to be an expert in 3D to have fun
- reduces the amount of code to write by a lot
- documentation and examples are amazing too: https://threejs.org/

</v-clicks>
</div>

<!--
geometries, lights, materials, etc... are available out of the box

3D can have quite some requirement regarding the physics, maths, what is a quaternion, how to make a matrix rotation etc...most of it is not needed when working with ThreeJS

let's see how to write the same with ThreeJS

[demo of the simple geometry /02 + proper spinning cube]

as you can see, the difference is quite substantial and far more readable (especially if you're used of writting JS)

far better than to read 300 pages of an old book with just text

<h2 class="mb-8 !text-4xl">What do we need exactly?</h2>

<div class="flex">
<img class="h-84" src="https://threejs.org/manual/resources/images/threejs-1cube-with-directionallight.svg" />

<div class="text-left">
<v-clicks>

- all the fundamentals are available [here](https://threejs.org/manual/#en/fundamentals)
- renderer, wrapping all the other parts
- scene, the tree of our objects
- mesh 👉 geometry + material
- geometry, the shape of our object
- material, the surface properties
- light, so that we see our objects
- texture (optional)

</v-clicks>
</div>

</div>

<style>
.slidev-layout ul {
  list-style-type: initial
}
</style>

<!--
a renderer receives a scene and a camera to render all of them down the tree

the scene contains lights, geometries, cameras, materials, etc... this hierarchy is containing all
the children and the info about where they are aiming, where they appear. think of it as a scene in a film.

the mesh helps us know the position and orientation of each cube

the geometry will indicate us if it's a sphere, cube, taco, dog, building of a conference etc...

a material can be shiny, rough, transparent, etc... it's the surface of our object and is basically
represented by any specifics that you can find in real world

a light is usually needed especially if the object is not glowing by itself

a texture is usually an image or a canvas, for example some patterns of grass/dirt/rock holes

all of those have a lot of variants with customizable properties and all of them are available thanks to ThreeJS
